# Satellite Image Classification Project

## Project Overview

In this repository, you will build and validate a classification model using satellite image data.

## Dataset Description

The dataset provided consists of two `.csv` files:

- **Image Data**: Contains an eight-band satellite image data.
- **Labels**: Contains the corresponding labels.

The dataset includes the following columns:

- **x** and **y**: Coordinates of the pixels.
- **band1-band8**: Brightness values for each band.
- **label**: Indicates the land cover type for the pixels.

## Project Tasks

1. **Model Selection and Validation**:
   - Choose a classification algorithm to build your model.
   - Test multiple algorithms.
   - Determine which variables to use for splitting the data into training and validation samples.
   - Justify your chosen validation approach.

2. **Classification Results**:
   - Display the classification results using a confusion matrix and provide relevant accuracy/error metrics.

3. **Visualization**:
   - Plot the original satellite image
   - Plot predicted satellite image coloured according to specified labels
